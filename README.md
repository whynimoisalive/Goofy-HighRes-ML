# Feature Extraction from Remote Sensing High Resolution Data using AI/ML

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced feature extraction system for high-resolution remote sensing data, focusing on identifying and mapping key infrastructure elements across diverse Indian landscapes. The system utilizes state-of-the-art AI and ML techniques to extract features such as ex-high tension towers, windmills, electric substations, brick kilns, and farmbunds.
