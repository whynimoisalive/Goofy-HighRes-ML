### **1. Cross-Validation on Training Data**

#### Resources:
- **What is Cross-Validation?** Cross-validation (CV) is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets (folds), training the model on some folds, and evaluating it on others. Common types of CV include k-fold CV and stratified CV.
- **How-To and Resources**:
    - **Scikit-Learn Documentation**: Scikit-Learn provides a convenient `cross_val_score` function for cross-validation. You can use it to evaluate your model's performance using different metrics. Here's an example of how to use it with Python⁹.
    - **Machine Learning Mastery**: This blog post explains k-fold cross-validation in detail and provides Python code examples[^10^].

- **Scikit-learn Documentation**: Provides comprehensive details on cross-validation techniques, including K-Fold, Leave-One-Out, and Stratified K-Fold.
  - [Scikit-learn Cross-Validation Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)

- **Machine Learning Mastery**: Offers tutorials and examples of cross-validation in Python.
  - [Machine Learning Mastery Cross-Validation Guide](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/)

#### Git Repositories:
- **scikit-learn**: The repository includes examples and implementations of cross-validation techniques.
  - [scikit-learn GitHub Repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

### **2. Model Performance Metrics**

#### Resources:
- **What are Precision, Recall, and F1-Score?** These metrics are essential for assessing classification models:
     - **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
     - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
     - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when you want to balance both metrics.
- **How-To and Resources**:
    - **V7 Labs Guide**: This article explains confusion matrices and how to compute precision, recall, and F1-score⁹.
    - **Adventures in Machine Learning**: Another comprehensive guide on evaluating classification models, including confusion matrices and related metrics[^10^].

- **Scikit-learn Documentation**: Details on performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and others.
  - [Scikit-learn Metrics Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)

- **Towards Data Science**: Provides practical examples and explanations of evaluation metrics.
  - [Towards Data Science Metrics Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-classification-metrics-aba3d08dd16d)

#### Git Repositories:
- **Metrics and Evaluation**: Examples and code for calculating precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
  - [Metrics Examples Repository](https://github.com/chriskhanh/metrics-examples)

### **3. Field Verification**

#### Resources:
- **What is Field Verification?** Field verification involves physically checking or validating features detected by a model. For example, if your model identifies certain objects in satellite imagery, field verification would involve visiting those locations to confirm their presence.
- **How-To and Resources**:
    - **HERS Verification**: In the context of energy efficiency features, HERS (Home Energy Rating System) field verification is performed by certified raters. It ensures compliance with energy efficiency requirements. You can find detailed procedures and requirements in the California Title 24 Reference¹.
    - **Pipeline Integrity Management**: In the context of pipelines, field verification confirms the condition of the pipeline based on reported features. This helps support necessary actions².
- **Remote Sensing Field Verification**: Guidelines and best practices for field verification of remote sensing data.
  - [Field Verification in Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/8/1262)

- **Google Scholar**: Search for research papers on field verification for specific types of features.
  - [Google Scholar Field Verification](https://scholar.google.com/)

#### Git Repositories:
- **Field Verification Tools**: Tools and scripts for field data collection and validation.
  - [Field Data Collection Repository](https://github.com/OpenDataScience/Field-Data-Collection)

### **4. Confusion Matrix Analysis**

#### Resources:
- **What is a Confusion Matrix?** A confusion matrix summarizes a classification model's performance by comparing predicted labels to true labels. It provides insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **How-To and Resources**:
    - **V7 Labs Guide**: The same article that covers confusion matrices also explains how to interpret them and calculate related metrics⁹.
    - **Adventures in Machine Learning**: Another guide specifically demystifying confusion matrices and their interpretation[^10^].
- **Scikit-learn Documentation**: Explanation and examples for creating and interpreting confusion matrices.
  - [Scikit-learn Confusion Matrix Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)

- **Towards Data Science**: Articles explaining the confusion matrix and its application in model evaluation.
  - [Confusion Matrix Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-confusion-matrix-a9ad42dcfd62)

#### Git Repositories:
- **Confusion Matrix Examples**: Implementations and examples of confusion matrix analysis.
