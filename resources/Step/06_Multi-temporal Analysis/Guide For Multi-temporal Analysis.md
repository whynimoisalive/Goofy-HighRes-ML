### 1. Implement Change Detection Algorithms (e.g., LSTMs for Time Series Analysis)
- Change detection is crucial for monitoring temporal variations in data. While there are various methods, one powerful approach involves using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** for time series analysis. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture temporal dependencies and detect anomalies or changes over time.

#### Resources and Documentation:
- The paper titled "Deep Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: A Survey" provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques for anomaly detection in time series data, including LSTMs ยน.

### 2. Develop Models to Distinguish Between Seasonal Changes and Infrastructure Modifications
- To differentiate between seasonal variations and infrastructure-related modifications, consider using statistical methods or machine learning models. You might explore **seasonal decomposition** techniques (e.g., STL decomposition) to separate seasonal components from trends and irregularities.

#### Resources and Documentation:
- The study titled "How fast do landscapes change? A workflow to analyze temporal changes in human-dominated landscapes" discusses detecting landscape changes within seasons โถ.

### 3. Create a Temporal Smoothing Algorithm to Reduce Noise in Time Series Data
- Temporal smoothing aims to reduce noise and enhance the signal in time series data. Several algorithms can achieve this:
     - **Savitzky-Golay Filter**: A polynomial smoothing technique that preserves important features while removing noise.
     - **Constrained Spline Regression**: Balances noise reduction with preserving information about variance.
     - **Double-Logistic Smoothing**: Suitable for seasonal data.

#### Resources and Documentation:
 - The paper "Temporal classification of short time series data" introduces a novel approach for classifying short time series signals, which includes temporal smoothing ยน.
- Additionally, explore the GitHub repository [TempClass](https://github.com/CSBiology/TempClass) for an open-source implementation of the proposed method ยน.
