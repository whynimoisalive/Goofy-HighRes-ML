### 1. Calculate Vegetation Indices (e.g., NDVI)

#### Resources:
- One common vegetation index is the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**, which quantifies vegetation health based on the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red light reflectance. You can find implementations and examples in Python on GitHub. For a comprehensive guide, check out the repository titled "A Guide for Feature Engineering and Feature Selection" Â².

### 4. Compute Local Binary Patterns for Texture Analysis

#### Resources:
- Local Binary Patterns are useful for texture analysis. They encode local patterns in an image by comparing pixel values with their neighbors. Look for repositories that focus on feature extraction and texture analysis.

- **Scikit-Image Documentation**: [Local Binary Patterns](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_local_binary_pattern.html)
