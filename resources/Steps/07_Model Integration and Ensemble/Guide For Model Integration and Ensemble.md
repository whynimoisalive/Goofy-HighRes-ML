### Design a Pipeline that Combines Outputs from Different Algorithms

#### Resources and Documentation
- When it comes to combining outputs from different algorithms, ensemble methods play a crucial role. They allow us to create more robust and accurate models by leveraging the strengths of individual algorithms. Here are a few resources related to ensemble modeling:
     - **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server with Ensemble Models**: NVIDIA Triton is an open-source inference serving software that supports ensemble models. It allows you to define an inference pipeline as an ensemble of models in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This can be useful for combining predictions from different ML models within a pipeline¹.
     - **Automated Machine Learning with Dynamic Ensemble Selection**: This research paper proposes a novel AutoML method based on dynamic ensemble selection. It selects and aggregates the most competent combination of base pipelines to predict specific unseen instances².
     - **Ensemble Modeling with Scikit-Learn Pipelines**: If you're working with Python, Scikit-Learn provides tools for creating ensemble models, including stacking and voting classifiers. Stacking involves training a meta-classifier on the outputs of base classifiers, while voting classifiers combine predictions through majority voting or averaging³.

### Implement a Voting System or Stacking Classifier to Merge Predictions

#### Resources and Documentation
- Both voting and stacking classifiers are ensemble techniques. Let's briefly differentiate them:
     - **Voting Classifiers**:
       - In voting classifiers, multiple base classifiers predict class labels for unseen data. There are two types:
         - **Hard Voting**: Each base classifier predicts a class label, and the majority class label becomes the final prediction.
         - **Soft Voting**: Base classifiers provide probability distributions over all possible classes, and the class label with the highest average probability across all classifiers is selected.
       - You can implement voting classifiers using Scikit-Learn⁸.
     - **Stacking Classifiers**:
       - Stacking (or stacked generalization) combines predictions from base classifiers by training a meta-classifier on their outputs. The goal is to build a more accurate and robust final model.
       - Steps for creating a stacking classifier:
         1. Select diverse base classifiers.
         2. Split the data into training subsets for base classifiers and meta-classifier.
         3. Train base classifiers and create input for the meta-classifier.
         4. Train the meta-classifier to combine base classifier predictions.
         5. Use the stacking classifier for predictions.

### Develop a Confidence Scoring Mechanism for Each Detected Feature

#### Resources and Documentation
- Building confidence in model outputs, especially from large language models (LLMs), is essential. LLMs sometimes hallucinate answers, leading to uncertainty. Here are some approaches:
     - **Model Explainability**: Understand how the model arrived at its decision. Techniques like SHAP values, LIME, and attention maps can help.
     - **Confidence Scoring**: Develop a mechanism to estimate the confidence of LLM outputs. This can involve meta-models observing base model success/failure⁵.
     - **Attribution**: Identify which parts of the input contribute most to the output.
   - At Alkymi, they focus on these aspects to build confidence in LLM-powered tools.
