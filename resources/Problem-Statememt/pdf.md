## Detailed Solution and Approach (250-300 words)

Our solution proposes an innovative, multi-faceted approach to extract features such as ex-high tension towers, windmills, electric substations, brick kilns, and farmbunds from high-resolution remote sensing data in the Indian context. The core of our approach lies in combining advanced machine learning techniques with domain-specific algorithms tailored to each feature type.

We start with comprehensive data collection, including multi-spectral imagery, SAR, and LiDAR data when available. Our preprocessing pipeline ensures data quality through atmospheric correction, radiometric calibration, and co-registration of multi-source data.

The feature engineering phase leverages both traditional remote sensing indices and advanced texture analysis techniques. We employ multi-resolution segmentation to create object primitives, allowing for efficient and accurate feature identification.

Our machine learning model integrates both traditional classifiers (e.g., Random Forests, SVM) and deep learning architectures (e.g., U-Net, Mask R-CNN) to achieve robust feature detection. We've developed feature-specific algorithms, such as line detection for ex-high tension towers and circular Hough transform for windmills, to enhance accuracy.

A key innovation is our multi-temporal analysis component, which uses LSTMs to differentiate between seasonal changes and infrastructure modifications. This is crucial for monitoring dynamic landscapes in India.

We've also implemented contextual refinement using GIS data and spatial relationship analysis, significantly reducing false positives. Our solution includes a cloud-based processing pipeline for scalability and an active learning system for continuous improvement.
