# AI-Powered Feature Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data

## Problem Statement

Develop an advanced AI/ML solution to extract features from high-resolution remote sensing data, providing three levels of output:

1. Tags (Multi-label classification)
2. Bounding boxes (Object localization)
3. Masks (Pixel-wise segmentation)

Create a web application to deploy the model, allowing users to interact with the system and provide feedback on the results.

## Key Objectives

- Prepare a comprehensive dataset with three-tiered labeling
- Develop robust models for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks
