# AI-Powered Feature Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data

## <span style="color: lightgreen;">Problem Statement</span>

<span style="color: cyan;">1. Develop an advanced AI/ML solution to extract features from high-resolution remote sensing data, providing three levels of output:
   - Tags (Multi-label classification)
   - Bounding boxes (Object localization)
   - Masks (Pixel-wise segmentation)</span>

    Suggestion: Implement a multi-task learning architecture to leverage shared features across all three tasks, improving overall efficiency and performance.

   

<span style="color: cyan;">2. Create a web application to deploy the model, allowing users to interact with the system and provide feedback on the results.</span>

    Suggestion: Develop a user-friendly interface with interactive visualization tools, enabling users to easily upload images, view results, and provide detailed feedback on each output type.

## <span style="color: lightgreen;">Key Objectives</span>

<span style="color: cyan;">- Prepare a comprehensive dataset with three-tiered labeling</span>

    Suggestion: Utilize active learning techniques to prioritize the most informative samples for labeling, reducing annotation costs while maximizing dataset quality.

<span style="color: cyan;">- Develop robust models for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks</span>

    Suggestion: Explore state-of-the-art architectures like Transformers or hybrid CNN-Transformer models, which have shown promising results in remote sensing applications.

<span style="color: cyan;">- Implement post-processing techniques for output refinement</span>

    Suggestion: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge to design custom post-processing algorithms, such as morphological operations or context-aware refinement techniques.

<span style="color: cyan;">- Deploy an interactive web application for model usage and feedback collection</span>

    uggestion: Implement a real-time feedback loop that uses incoming user feedback to trigger model fine-tuning, ensuring continuous improvement of the system.

## <span style="color: lightgreen;">Expected Deliverables</span>

<span style="color: cyan;">1. A curated remote sensing feature dataset</span>

    Suggestion: Create a diverse dataset that includes challenging edge cases and rare features to ensure robust model performance across various scenarios.

<span style="color: cyan;">2. High-performance AI models for multi-task feature extraction</span>

    Suggestion: Implement ensemble methods or model distillation techniques to balance performance and computational efficiency.

<span style="color: cyan;">3. Innovative post-processing algorithms for mask refinement</span>

    Suggestion: Develop a learnable post-processing module that can be fine-tuned end-to-end with the main model.

<span style="color: cyan;">4. User-friendly web application with feedback mechanism and database integration</span>

    Suggestion: Implement a progressive web app (PWA) design to enable offline functionality and improve accessibility across devices.

## <span style="color: lightgreen;">Technical Stack</span>

<span style="color: cyan;">- Data Preparation: Q-GIS
- Model Development: Python, GDAL, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Deployment: Python (e.g., Streamlit)</span>

        Suggestion: Consider integrating cloud-based services for scalable processing and storage, such as AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform.

## <span style="color: lightgreen;">Evaluation Criteria</span>

<span style="color: cyan;">- Classification: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score
- Localization & Segmentation: IoU, mAP
- Web Application: Usability, responsiveness, feedback integration</span>

        Suggestion: Include additional metrics specific to remote sensing, such as the Kappa coefficient for classification and the Boundary F1 score for segmentation, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance.
